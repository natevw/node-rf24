# node-rf24

Talk with your Arduino or other ÂµC-driven remotely from node.js, via an nRF24L01+ wireless radio transceiver [connected to a Raspberry Pi](https://gist.github.com/natevw/5789019)/BeagleBone/etc.

Simply `npm install rf24` and `require('rf24')` in your code to use the API.

[Actually, now have to clone this, `git submodule init && git submodule update && npm build .`]
